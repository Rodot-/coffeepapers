# coffeepapers

Just run query.py with whatever titles of papers using underscores for spaces. Query will fetch those papers from arxiv and build a new papers.js. That file is used to build the website located at jvshields.github.io/coffeepapers/

So if you grab query.py and then use it to build your papers.js, just push that new papers.js to the repo and the website will update.
